## Introduction

During the mid-20th century, the world witnessed a period of intense nuclear experimentation driven by the United States and the Soviet Union. These tests, conducted primarily between 1945 and 1951, marked significant milestones in the development of nuclear weapons technology and the escalation of the Cold War. The data presented here provides a glimpse into this tumultuous era, documenting the details of nuclear tests carried out by these two superpowers.


## About the Dataset
This dataset contains information about nuclear tests conducted between 1945 and 1951 by The United States, The Soviet Union, France, China, The United Kingdom, India and Pakistan. The data includes details such as the year of the test, unique identification numbers, countries where the tests were conducted, regions within those countries, the responsible organization (e.g., DOE), geographical coordinates of the test sites, magnitudes of the explosions, depths of the tests, estimated yields, and purposes of the tests.


## Columns Description:
1. year: Year of the nuclear test.
2. id_no: Unique identification number for each test.
3. country: Country where the test was conducted (e.g., USA, USSR).
4. region: Specific region within the country where the test was conducted.
5. source: Organization responsible for conducting the test (e.g., DOE).
6. latitude: Latitude coordinate of the test site.
7. longitude: Longitude coordinate of the test site.
8.vmagnitude_body: Magnitude of the explosion (body wave magnitude).
9. magnitude_surface: Magnitude of the explosion (surface wave magnitude).
10. depth: Depth of the test.
11. yield_lower: Lower estimate of the explosive yield of the test.
12. yield_upper: Upper estimate of the explosive yield of the test.
13. purpose: Purpose of the test (e.g., WR for weapons research).
14. name: Name of the nuclear test.
15. type: Type of test (e.g., airdrop, surface, tower, UW).


## Usage
Researchers, historians, and analysts can utilize this dataset to delve into the historical context of nuclear testing, examine the technological advancements in weapons research, and explore the geopolitical implications of these activities during the mid-20th century.
